     cd "c:\Users\santh\OneDrive\Desktop\all tiamil"
   - Run the script:
     python update_cast_sample.py

5. WHAT THE SCRIPT DOES:
   - Reads your "imdb_tamil_movies_full.json" file
   - For each movie, fetches cast information from OMDB API
   - Creates a new file "imdb_tamil_movies_with_cast.json" with the updated data
   - Preserves existing data and adds cast information

6. AFTER RUNNING THE SCRIPT:
   - Replace your original "imdb_tamil_movies_full.json" with the new file
   - Or rename "imdb_tamil_movies_with_cast.json" to "imdb_tamil_movies_full.json"
   - Refresh your web application to see the cast information

NOTE: The script includes a 1-second delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the API.
You can adjust this by changing the "delay" parameter in the update_movies_with_cast function.
